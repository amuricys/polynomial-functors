% This chapter gives a short introduction to the technology used and different areas of knowledge that is needed to understand this thesis. Starting with explaining \textbf{Agda}, which is the programming language used for the formalization. Going on to \textbf{Cubical Agda} which is an extension to \textbf{Agda} providing useful constructs aiding in writing proofs. Then to \textbf{Category Theory}


% This chapter explains any background needed to understand this thesis. 

% the decisions made prior to starting the work - namely what technology to use, why, and what to use it for. We will also dedicate a brief effort to explaining the basics of category theory and its mechanisms for generalizing and illuminating the subjects it's applied to. Finally, we'll briefly explore the specific category of polynomial functors - \textbf{Poly}, its surprising amount of structure and numerous interpretations in many different contexts - in other words, we will explain why this work was done and why we believe \textbf{Poly}, and polynomial functors in general, to be important.

\section{Agda}
Agda is a dependently typed programming language \cite{agdaWebsite} created at Chalmers.
It is a functional language with very similar syntax to Haskell, but with a more powerful type system that allows it to be used as a proof assistant. 
Dependent types mean that types can depend on values. For example, a function can have the type signature \mintinline{agda}{natOrBool : (b : Bool) → if b then ℕ else Bool}, which means it returns a natural number if the value of the argument is true and a boolean if the value of the argument is false. In a non-dependent language, this would need to be expressed at the value level, so the function would have to return a value of type \mintinline{haskell}{Either ℕ Bool}.

\subsection{Unicode characters}
Agda, compared to most other languages, allows and makes heavy use of Unicode characters in symbol names. This can look daunting but provides for a concise syntax akin to mathematical notation. 

\subsection{Propositions as Types}
The Curry-Howard isomorphism \cite{propositionastypes} is the idea that there is a one-to-one correspondence between types in programming languages, propositions in logic, and expressions in algebra. Under this correspondence (isomorphism), a value of a type can be seen as a proof of the proposition the type corresponds to \cite{DependentTypesAtWork}. For example, the following data type in Agda corresponds to the logical operator \texttt{or} (written $A \vee B$):

\begin{minted}{agda}
data Either (A B : Type) : Set where
    inj₁ : A → Either A B
    inj₂ : B → Either A B
\end{minted}

Concretely, an element of type \texttt{Either A B} is either an element of \texttt{A}, contained in the first value constructor \texttt{inj₁}, or of the type \texttt{B}, contained in the second value constructor \texttt{inj₂}. This corresponds to the fact that that a proof of the logical proposition $A \vee B$ is either a proof of the proposition \texttt{A} or a proof of \texttt{B}. This, in turn, also corresponds to summing in algebra - $A + B$. A summary of the isomorphism is given below:

\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabular}{lll}
Algebra      & Logic                   & Types \\
$A + B$      & $A \vee B$              & \texttt{Either A B} \\
$A \times B$ & $A \wedge B$            & \texttt{Pair A B}\\
$B^A$        & $ A \implies B$         & \texttt{A -> B} \\
$A = B$      & $ A \iff B$             & \texttt{Iso A B}\\
$0$          & $ false $               & \texttt{⊥}\\
$1$          & $ true  $               & \texttt{⊤}
\end{tabular}
\end{table}


The Curry-Howard isomorphism and Agda's powerful type system make Agda a powerful proof checker.


\subsection{Agda examples}
The \mintinline{agda}{Either} example above shows how (polymorphic) data types are defined, similar to the GADTs \cite{ghc-gadts} extension of Haskell.

It is also possible to create record types for data types with only one constructor.

\begin{minted}{agda}
record Action : Type where
  constructor mkAction
  field
    write : Alphabet
    move : Movement
\end{minted}

The unit type and unit function are defined as:
\begin{minted}{agda}
data ⊤ : Type where
    tt : ⊤

unit : {A : Type} → A → ⊤
unit _ = tt
\end{minted}

The bottom (or False) type and the absurd function from bottom:
\begin{minted}{agda}
data ⊥ : Type where

absurd : {A : Type} → ⊥ → A
absurd ()
\end{minted}

The \texttt{natOrBool} function can be implemented as:
\begin{minted}{agda}
natOrBool : (b : Bool) → if b then ℕ else Bool
natOrBool true = 0
natOrBool false = true
\end{minted}

More explanations and examples of Agda can be found in \cite{agdaWebsite} and \cite{DependentTypesAtWork}. Otherwise, it should be possible to understand the more advanced concepts of Agda along the thesis.

\subsection{Foreign function interface - Haskell}
Agda has a fully-featured foreign function interface (FFI) with Haskell, providing access to the vast Haskell ecosystem. The FFI is important to the application section, to use well-established libraries for plotting graphs, writing versatile command-line interfaces, and fast matrix inversion. For a more detailed description of the supporting Haskell code and its use, see appendix \ref{app:haskell}.


%The programming language Agda is a natural choice for this project. Dependently typed programming languages allow for the expression of an incredibly vast array of mathematical concepts with the appropriate rigor, and Agda is a mature and robust language in this space. 

%It also has a fully-featured FFI to work with its compilation target, Haskell. This is important to our application work, where we sometimes need to use the Haskell ecosystem to produce things like plots and graphs and use BLAS-based matrix multiplication algorithms. 

% Further, Agda is developed within Chalmers, which allows us access to a great deal of expertise in the details of the language within the University.

\section{Cubical Agda}
Cubical \cite{cubicalAgdaDocs} is an extension of Agda, bringing ideas from Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) \cite{hottBook}. The main contribution of Cubical Agda is how to deal with equality.

Normal Agda defines equality as a data type. However, this (propositional) equality has certain problems. For example, it is not possible to prove function extensionality, that two functions are equal if they are equal for all arguments. Functional extensionality, which is very useful, is directly provable in Cubical.

Cubical discards this data type and uses its own notion of equality, the path. An equality between elements $a : A$ and $b : A$ is a path from $a$ to $b$.
Cubical achieves this with a function $p : I \rightarrow A$ satisfying some conditions. Firstly, $I$ is a special kind of variable representing an interval or a path ranging from $0$ to $1$. It can be thought of as a type representing an interval, although it isn't a type. Secondly, the beginning of the path must be $a$, that is $p(0)=a$. Finally, the end of the path must be $b$, $p(1)=b$. The important thing to note is that given \mintinline{agda}{a b : A}, a type \mintinline{agda}{a ≡ b} is a function \mintinline{agda}{I → A} behind the scenes, satisfying the above conditions. 

The equality \mintinline{agda}{a ≡ b} is known as homogeneous equality because $a$ and $b$ have the same type. It is also possible to have an equality when $a$ and $b$ are of different types, named heterogeneous equality. Homogeneous equality is a special case of heterogeneous equality, where $a$ and $b$ have the same type. For this thesis, mostly equality between elements of a fixed type is used, so no further explanation of heterogeneous equality is needed.

It is also possible to combine Cubical Agda with propositional equality. Using the functions \mintinline{agda}{pathToEq} and \mintinline{agda}{eqToPath}, it is possible to go back and forth between the two different notions of equality, which is useful in some cases.

There exists a standard Cubical library \cite{cubicalLibrary} that has plenty of constructs and proofs from HoTT. The Cubical library is extensively used in this project.

A useful property of Cubical Agda is that the type of isomorphisms is the same as the type of equalities. It is possible to go back and forth using \mintinline{agda}{isoToPath} and \mintinline{agda}{pathToIso}, from the standard Cubical library. This means that one way to prove an equality is to prove an isomorphism.

A final property, which is used heftily in this thesis, is substitution. Substitution makes it possible to transfer a property over an equality. The declaration of substitution, somewhat simplified, is 

\begin{minted}{agda}
subst : {A : Type} {x y : A} {B : A → Type} → (x ≡ y) → B x → B y
\end{minted}

The next subsection gives some more examples of Cubical Agda. Further information about Cubical Agda and HoTT can be found in  \cite{cubicalPaper} and \cite{hottBook}.

\subsection{Cubical examples}
The first example is to show that the absurd function, defined before, is unique. Given any other function from the empty type, it is the same function as absurd. Function extensionality is used to prove an equality between functions. Finally, the lemma is easily proved by pattern matching on the empty type.

\begin{minted}{agda}
absurdUnique : {A : Type} → (f : ⊥ → A) → f ≡ absurd
absurdUnique f = funExt lemma
    where
        lemma : (x : ⊥) → f x ≡ absurd x
        lemma ()
\end{minted}

In propositional equality, \mintinline{agda}{refl} is the constructor of the inductive data type representing equality, which provides a way to prove that any element $a$, is equal to itself. In Cubical, the function \mintinline{agda}{refl} is used instead. This function satisfies the requirement of being $a$ at both endpoints of the interval since it is constantly $a$. 

\begin{minted}{agda}
refl : {A : Type} → {a : A} → a ≡ a
refl {a = a} i = a
\end{minted}


% Cubical Type Theory \cite{cubical} is a setting in which the Univalence Axiom from Homotopy Type Theory is computable. In Agda, this allows certain constructs to be defined more directly and for the expression of their properties to be much simplified. An example of this is set quotients - Dependent Martin-Löf Type Theory tends to avoid set quotients to instead rely on setoids. However, to express notions like set coequalizers cleanly, one needs quotients, and Cubical Agda allows them to be simply definable as Higher Inductive Types - HITs.

% Another major benefit to our work that Cubical Agda provides is that function extensionality is provable in HoTT. Since we are working on categorical formalizations, we constantly want to prove equalities of arrows in \textbf{Poly}, a problem that will turn out to be proving equalities of dependent and non-dependent functions.

% Yet another benefit is that doing Category Theory in a HoTT setting is just \textit{nice}. In Category Theory, mathematicians are often careful to distinguish strict equality from isomorphism, but in HoTT this distinction conveniently vanishes. We make extensive use of this fact via the function \textit{isoToPath} from the Cubical library. The HoTT book goes in more detail on how to do a constructive category theory in the context of HoTT, and this talk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nalC40POVLU by David Jaz Myers, author of one of the main references of this thesis \cite{css}, explains in a more relaxed fashion as well. 

% There's also no loss of expressivity, since the Cubical library allows to convert back and forth between cubical and propositional equality via the functions \textit{pathToEq} and \textit{eqToPath}; another tool we use frequently.

% Finally, our supervisor Felix Cherubini is an experienced homotopy type theorist, on whose expertise we're happy to have been able to rely.

\section{Category Theory}
Category theory (CT) is used heavily in this thesis. CT is the formal study of composition, building larger relationships from smaller ones. Its central objects of study are categories, where a category consists of some data and satisfies some laws. The most well-known category in computer science is the category of types and functions, but in this thesis, other categories are explored. 

%We make use of CT in this project in three different regards: we sometimes need to think about category theory in general and what is true in a pure context, sometimes how to apply categorical concepts to concrete scientific and engineering contexts, and sometimes on the syntactic issue of how to translate statements about CT to statements in Agda and its type theories. We will briefly expand on these three regards now.

% \subsection{In general: pure and applied CT}

%We think of Category Theory as the formal study of composition - meaning connecting two relationships to form a larger one. It has some axioms that always hold for its central object of study, which is categories themselves, and definitions that build on top of these axioms that allow a highly rigorous but simple form of abstract reasoning about either structures that exist within categories or between them. 

%The definitions and associated axioms are extremely simple; a \textit{category} $\mathcal{C}$ consists of the following data:
A \textit{category} $\mathcal{C}$ consists of the following data:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A collection of objects Ob($\mathcal{C}$).
  \item For every two objects $A$ and $B$, a set of \textit{arrows} (also called \textit{morphisms} or \textit{maps}) between them denoted by $\mathcal{C}$(A , B). Individual arrows, when they need to be named, are written like this: $f : A \rightarrow B $.
  \item For every object $A$, an identity arrow $id : A \rightarrow A$. 
  \item A composition operator $ \circ $ , that gives rise to new arrows. For any three objects $A$, $B$ and $C$ and arrows $f : A \rightarrow B $ and $g : B \rightarrow C $, there exists an arrow $g \circ f : A \rightarrow C $.
\end{enumerate}

A category must fulfill the identity and associativity laws:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item $ \forall f. f \circ id = id \circ f = f $ (identity)
  \item $ \forall f\text{ }g\text{ }h. f \circ (g \circ h) = (f \circ g) \circ h $ (associativity of composition)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Commuting diagrams}
The usual way of representing statements in category theory is through \textit{commuting diagrams}. Such as:

 % https://q.uiver.app/?q=WzAsNCxbMCwxLCJBIl0sWzIsMSwiQyJdLFsxLDIsIkIiXSxbMSwwLCJEIl0sWzAsMiwiZiJdLFsyLDEsImciXSxbMCwzLCJoIl0sWzMsMSwiayJdXQ==
 % https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMCwxLCJBIl0sWzIsMSwiQyJdLFsxLDIsIkIiXSxbMSwwLCJEIl0sWzAsMiwiZiJdLFsyLDEsImciXSxbMCwzLCJoIl0sWzMsMSwiayJdXQ==
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	& D \\
	A && C \\
	& B
	\arrow["f", from=2-1, to=3-2]
	\arrow["g", from=3-2, to=2-3]
	\arrow["h", from=2-1, to=1-2]
	\arrow["k", from=1-2, to=2-3]
\end{tikzcd}\]
%  \begin{tikzcd}
%  	& D \\
%  	A && C \\
%  	& B
%  	\arrow["f", from=2-1, to=3-2]
%  	\arrow["g", from=3-2, to=2-3]
%  	\arrow["h", from=2-1, to=1-2]
%  	\arrow["k", from=1-2, to=2-3]
%  \end{tikzcd}

Here, the objects are $ A $, $ B $, $ C $ and $ D $, and the arrows are $ f : A \rightarrow B $, $ g : B \rightarrow C $, $ h : A \rightarrow D $ and $ k : D \rightarrow C $. Composite arrows and identity arrows are usually omitted from the diagram but are always there implicitly. \textit{Commuting} means that any path between two objects is the same; for this example $ k \circ h = g \circ f $. In a sense, diagrams can be seen as category theory's analog of abstract algebraic equations. Like equations handle symbols that can stand for anything, diagrams are an abstract representation of some structure in a category, containing objects and morphisms labeled and subject to constraints like being equal or unique, and should be interpreted as a statement. It should be emphasized that in general settings of category theory, the meaning of the objects and arrows doesn't play any role - they are purposefully abstract. All that matters is the structure of the relationship between objects and arrows, which is why abstract commuting diagrams are useful. Concrete categories ought to have meaning to their arrows and what it means to compose them, like the category \textbf{Set}, where objects are sets and arrows are functions between them. 

% They must also respect the laws to be categories of course. In our case, because the thesis has a large focus on applied category theory, we will also talk frequently about the meaning of the arrows and objects in \textbf{Poly} and some closely related categories; it's what makes them interesting after all.

\subsection{Applied category theory}

Although the definition of a category may not seem like much, it reveals \textit{the point} of category theory: it is a theory of \textit{compositionality}. What it means to compose relationships between objects, what facts are preserved under different compositions, how composing can generalize: this and other deep structural questions are at the core of this theory. 

In this spirit of investigating compositionality, \textit{applied} category theory is done. The main introductory textbook on the subject, \textit{Seven Sketches in Compositionality} \cite{seven-sketches}, does a good job of justifying this approach. The book usually starts with motivating examples in the real world and what CT and its constructions and formalisms can bring to understanding them in better, or at least different ways. For this thesis, the order is reversed; the theory is covered first, but the goal of applying is always present.

There are many constructions and structures in CT which would not be feasible to explain in this section. Instead, they are introduced as they become relevant.


%Defining the main point of study of category theory is barely scratching the surface. 

%There are many constructions and structures within the theory that we cannot explain in any detail that would do them justice here; instead we will introduce other concepts in CT as they become relevant.



\subsection{In code: Agda's \texttt{agda-categories} library}

The poly-book demonstrates many category-theoretic constructs in the context of \textbf{Poly}, but this thesis is limited to the most essential ones. These tend to be quite ubiquitous, and as such, there are formulations of many of them in the Agda ecosystem: the three main ones are the 1lab \cite{1lab}, the Cubical library's own \cite{cubical-cat}, and the \texttt{agda-categories} \cite{agda-cats} library. For this thesis, the third one is picked for a few reasons: firstly, it is very well documented, with a sensible user interface and active community. Secondly, it has more constructs: for example, it is the only one of the three in which the exponential object, a key feature of \textbf{Poly}, is present. Thirdly, it is interoperable with Cubical, since the definition of a category requires a user to provide an equivalence relation to express equality between arrows, where cubical equality can be supplied.
%\texttt{Agda-categories} provides a general scaffolidng making sure the formalizations of the categorical concepts in \textbf{Poly} are correct. % Sometimes, it also helps by providing pre-existing implementations of categories; for instance, polynomials are functors, and so we will often rely on the provided instance of the category of \textbf{Set} of sets and functions.

\section{Previous work on Polynomial Functors}

The study of polynomial functors has an extensive literature in the pure category-theoretic setting, like the work of Joachim Kock \cite{kockpoly} \cite{kock2009polynomial}. In contrast, the \textbf{poly-book}, the main book of this thesis, is focused on applied category theory, providing interpretations of abstract mathematical structures and mapping them to concrete concepts and applications. Some of the most mature interpretations are database theory, decision systems, and dynamical systems. One of the book's authors, David Spivak, has done work using \textbf{Poly} in the context of database theory \cite{spivak2023functorial}. The book also spends some time developing intuitions on the decision-making perspective, but not much work in this area could be found. Finally, there is the interpretation of \textbf{Poly} in dynamical systems, which the book provides many examples of.
