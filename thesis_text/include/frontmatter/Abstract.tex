\section*{Abstract}

The category of polynomial functors - \textbf{Poly} - has been studied for over two decades and is well known for its relevance to computer science \cite{containersPaper} and deep mathematical structure \cite{polynomialFunctorsCategory}.
In recent years, new interpretations of Poly have been found in dynamical systems theory \cite{poly-book}. 
This thesis formalizes Poly in Cubical Agda and showcases its use in dynamical systems, contributing to the Poly code ecosystem.
% In the first part, the theory of the category Poly is formalized, together with a closely related category called Chart. 
% In the second part, these categories are used to build many examples of dynamical systems. % , together with many examples of dynamical systems.

The first part, theory, formalizes the category Poly itself and many of its categorical constructs, including the initial and terminal objects, product, coproduct, equalizer, composition and parallel product. % , among others. % as two monoids, and many various proofs around the category.
Then Chart is formalized, together with its own categorical constructs.
Finally, Poly and Chart morphisms are combined via commuting squares.   %, aoeuaoeu
% The combination of Poly and Chart as commuting squares is given, which is meaningful for the dynamical interpretation.

The second part, practice, builds upon the theory by using these categories to implement dynamical systems.
It covers how morphisms in Poly represent dynamical systems, how polynomials act as interfaces, how
systems are wired together, how behavior is installed into wiring diagrams, and how to run systems arriving at concrete programs.
Many dynamical system examples are given, such as a Fibonacci sequence generator, the Lorenz system, the Hodkgin-Huxley model, and an Echo-State Network that learns the Lorenz dynamics. %reservoir computers.
Commuting squares are used as a way of showing that one dynamical system can be made to simulate another.

%However, in recent years, researchers in the growing field of Applied Category Theory have found wider interpretations of the content of \textbf{Poly} and related topics, leading to applications in dynamical systems theory \cite{jaz http://davidjaz.com/Papers/DynamicalBook.pdf}, information theory \cite{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12878.pdf}, database theory \cite{spivak db https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10968.pdf} and more. 
%Many aspects of the well-behavedness and richness of interpretation of \textbf{Poly} are being collected in the textbook \textit{Polynomial Functors - A Mathematical Theory of Interaction \cite{poly-book}}.


%However, the surrounding code ecosystem of \textbf{Poly} is lacking. It is difficult to find straightforward formalizations and/or programs that use \textbf{Poly}'s structure to their advantage. The present work seeks to contribute to this ecosystem by providing formalizations in Cubical Agda of many existing theorems and categorical constructs in \textbf{Poly} and closely related categories, along with an array of concrete examples of its application to real world, widely studied dynamical systems. Most of the code follows the aforementioned textbook as a general blueprint, but since the very authors admit to the youth of applied category theory as a field and specifically its perspective on \textbf{Poly}, we sometimes deviate and show new applications.
