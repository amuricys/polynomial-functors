\section*{Abstract}
The category of polynomial functors - \textbf{Poly} - has been studied for over two decades, and is known for its relevance to computer science and type theory \cite{containers https://www.cs.le.ac.uk/people/ma139/docs/thesis.pdf}, as well as its deep mathematical structure \cite{koch https://arxiv.org/abs/0906.4931}. However, in recent years, researchers in the growing field of Applied Category Theory have found wider interpretations of the content of \textbf{Poly} and related topics, leading to applications in dynamical systems theory \cite{jaz http://davidjaz.com/Papers/DynamicalBook.pdf}, information theory \cite{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12878.pdf}, database theory \cite{spivak db https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.10968.pdf} and more. Many aspects of the well-behavedness and richness of interpretation of \textbf{Poly} are being collected in the textbook \textit{Polynomial Functors - A Mathematical Theory of Interaction \cite{poly-book}}.

However, the surrounding code ecosystem of \textbf{Poly} is lacking. It is difficult to find straightforward formalizations and/or programs that use \textbf{Poly}'s structure to their advantage. The present work seeks to contribute to this ecosystem by providing formalizations in Cubical Agda of many existing theorems and categorical constructs in \textbf{Poly} and closely related categories, along with an array of concrete examples of its application to real world, widely studied dynamical systems. Most of the code follows the aforementioned textbook as a general blueprint, but since the very authors admit to the youth of applied category theory as a field and specifically its perspective on \textbf{Poly}, we sometimes deviate and show new applications.
