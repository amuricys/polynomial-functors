\section{Acknowledgements}
Firstly, we would like to acknowledge and thank Naïm Camille Favier for the help via the Agda Zulip in several proofs: solving a problem with characterizing lens equality, making the inclusion map in set coequalizers type-check, and for general guidance in Agda-related questions.

%helping formulate the isomorphism of comonoids in \textbf{Poly} and small categories, 

Secondly, we would like to acknowledge David Orion Girardo for his succinct and beautiful formulation of the exponential object we used and for inspiration in Agda.


Thirdly, we thank David Spivak, co-author of the textbook we follow for this thesis and many of the papers we cite. We could not have done it without his and Nelson Niu's wonderful book. Or without his warm encouragement to pursue this project.

Finally, we thank our supervisor Felix Cherubini, whose patience, guidance, and expertise were instrumental in bringing this thesis to life.
